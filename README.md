# Hyperparameter Optimization and Interpretation in Machine Learning
Machine learning has undergone tremendous advancements, paving the way for a myriad of applications across industries. In the midst of this progress, the significance of hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation can't be understated, as they play a critical role in achieving optimal model performance. This project delves into the realm of ML model optimization and evaluation, harnessing Bayesian Optimization, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and traditional evaluation matrices. By focusing on a decision tree classifier, the study investigates the efficiency of various hyperparameter tuning methods, the interpretability of model decisions, and the robustness of performance metrics. Preliminary results suggest that Bayesian Optimization may offer advantages in efficiency over traditional tuning methods. Furthermore, SHAP values provide deeper insights into model decision-making, fostering better transparency and trust in ML applications. <br>
